# Server

This is a basic implementation of how the web server will work.

## Building

This app uses the excellent [Toast](https://github.com/stepchowfun/toast) program as a "Make" equivalent, using docker containers. It's very easy, all tasks are defined in `toast.yml`. The main one you'll want to use is `toast run`, which installs all dependencies and runs the app exposed on port `8080` on the host.

## Testing

Where we're going, we don't need "tests"
